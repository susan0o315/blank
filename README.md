# Design And Analysis CSE5311-01
# Project 1

Programming Language Used : Python 3

Files to run:
1. insertionsort.py
2. mergesort.py
3. quicksort.py

Output Files: 
1. arrIS_O_20.txt
2. arrIS_O_100.txt
3. arrIS_O_2000.txt
4. arrIS_O_6000.txt
5. arrMR_O_20.txt
6. arrMR_O_100.txt
7. arrMR_O_2000.txt
8. arrMR_O_6000.txt
9. arrQK_O_20.txt
10. arrQK_O_100.txt
11. arrQK_O_2000.txt
12. arrQK_O_5000.txt

How to run:
1. Go to command line terminal in your system and navigate to the folder where the files to run are located.
2. Make sure you have python installed and path added to the system environment
3. After everything is ready to go, type the following
4. > python insertion.py
   > python mergesort.py
   > python quicksort.py
5. if you have a linux/mac system, and the above lines don't work, try typing the same command with python3 instead of python.
6. If the commands executed properly and the 3 programs are run, you shopuld be able to see 12 extra files in the same folder of the "Files to run".
